## Lava and Kusha's First Performance

When Lava and Kusha first sang this epic before the assembly of sages:

> "The melody of the ballad, especially the meaning of verses, aha! Superb... 
> though this has happened long-ago it is shown like the one happening presently... 
> on getting into the mood of the epic, those two sang its import in one tune, 
> that too melodiously and rapturously, maintaining the pitch and tune..."

## Rama's Words to His Court

When Rama invited his brothers to hear the ballad:

**Sanskrit:**
```
इमौ मुनी पार्थिव लक्षणान्वितौ
कुशी लवौ चैव महातपस्विनौ।
ममापि तद्भूतिकरं प्रचक्षते
महानुभावं चरितं निबोधत॥
```

**Translation:**
"These two saint-like Kusha and Lava, who possess kingly features, are great hermits... 
This narration endows good fortune to me also, listen to that great efficacious legend [of Seetha...]"
